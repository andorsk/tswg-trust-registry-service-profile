# ToIP Service Profile Specification

This specification outlines the structure and requirements for enabling additional service discovery through profile definitions within a Decentralized Identifier (DID) document. By integrating service endpoints and profile information, this approach enhances the capabilities of DIDs for decentralized and self-sovereign identity systems. Some of the possible advantages include:

- service and profile crawlers become possible, enabling better service discovery and interoperability across services.
- better descriptive power for individual services composibility of capabilities for succinct representation of capabilities.
